A comprehensive implementation of autonomous quadcopter navigation using Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning enhanced with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications for mission-critical applications.

## 🚁 Project Overview

This project develops an autonomous quadcopter navigation system capable of executing complex, multi-stage surveillance missions in a simulated environment. The core innovation lies in integrating formal STL specifications directly into the reinforcement learning reward function, ensuring the learned policy inherently satisfies temporal and safety requirements.

### Key Features

- **Advanced TD3 Implementation**: State-of-the-art continuous control with clipped double-Q learning, target policy smoothing, and delayed policy updates
- **STL Integration**: Formal mission specification using Signal Temporal Logic with real-time robustness computation
- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: PyBullet-based physics simulation with realistic aerodynamics, sensor noise, and domain randomization
- **Mission Specification**: A → B → Charging Station → A infinite surveillance loop
- **Comprehensive Logging**: TensorBoard integration, trajectory analysis, and real-time monitoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, extensible codebase with advanced network architectures

## 🎯 Mission Specification

The quadcopter must repeatedly execute a surveillance loop:

1. **Start** at waypoint A (home base)
2. **Navigate** to waypoint B (surveillance target)
3. **Proceed** to charging station for battery replenishment
4. **Return** to waypoint A to complete the cycle
5. **Repeat** infinitely while maintaining safety constraints

This mission is formally specified using STL formulas that encode temporal requirements, safety constraints, and efficiency objectives.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd quadcopter_rl_project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv quadcopter_env
source quadcopter_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: quadcopter_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Basic Training

```bash
# Start training with default configuration
python src/main_training.py

# Or with custom configuration
python src/main_training.py --config config/hyperparameters.yaml
```

### 3. Monitor Training

```bash
# Launch TensorBoard (in separate terminal)
tensorboard --logdir logs/

# View at http://localhost:6006
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files for easy customization:

```yaml
# Example configuration excerpt
env:
  waypoint_A: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
  waypoint_B: [5.0, 5.0, 1.5]
  waypoint_charging: [2.5, -2.5, 0.5]
  waypoint_tolerance: 0.3

agent:
  lr_actor: 0.001
  lr_critic: 0.001
  batch_size: 256
  gamma: 0.99

stl:
  use_stl_reward: true
  stl_weight: 1.0
  mission_type: 'surveillance'
```

## 🧠 STL Integration

### Mission Formula Example

```stl
# STL specification for surveillance mission
G[0,∞] (
  (at_A → F[0,480] at_B) ∧           # From A, eventually reach B
  (at_B → F[0,480] at_charging) ∧    # From B, eventually reach charging
  (at_charging → F[0,480] at_A)      # From charging, return to A
) ∧ G[0,∞] safe                      # Always maintain safety
```

### Robustness Computation

The STL robustness score quantifies how well a trajectory satisfies the specification:
- **Positive values**: Formula is satisfied
- **Negative values**: Formula is violated
- **Magnitude**: Degree of satisfaction/violation

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom STL Formulas

```python
from stl_parser import create_quadcopter_mission_formula

# Create custom mission specification
waypoints = {
    'A': np.array([0, 0, 1]),
    'B': np.array([10, 10, 2]),
    'charging': np.array([5, -5, 1])
}

formula = create_quadcopter_mission_formula(
    waypoints, 
    mission_type='surveillance',
    time_bounds=(0, 100)
)
```

### Network Architecture Selection

```python
# Choose from multiple architectures
config = {
    'architecture': 'attention',  # 'standard', 'residual', 'ensemble'
    'hidden_dims': [512, 256],
    'use_layer_norm': True,
    'attention_heads': 8
}
```

### Hyperparameter Optimization

```bash
# Automated hyperparameter search
python src/main_training.py --config config/hyperparam_search.yaml
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PyBullet Installation**
   ```bash
   # If GUI issues on Linux
   sudo apt-get install python3-opengl
   ```

2. **CUDA Memory Issues**
   ```python
   # Reduce batch size or buffer size in config
   batch_size: 128  # Instead of 256
   ```

3. **STL Library Issues**
   ```bash
   # Install STL libraries from source if needed
   pip install git+https://github.com/stlrom/stlrom.git
   ```

### Performance Optimization

- **GPU Usage**: Ensure CUDA is properly installed
- **Parallel Environments**: Adjust `parallel_envs` in config
- **Memory Management**: Monitor with `psutil` and adjust buffer sizes
- **Logging Frequency**: Reduce for faster training
